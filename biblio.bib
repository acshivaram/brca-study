	abstract = {Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) use steadily increased in the Western world. In 2002, the early termination of the Women's Health Initiative trial due to an excess of adverse events attributable to HRT, led to a precipitous decline in its use. Breast cancer incidence began to decline soon thereafter in the USA and several other countries. However, the magnitude of the decline in breast cancer incidence, and its timing with respect to HRT cessation, shows considerable variability between nations. The impact of HRT cessation appears most significant and immediate in countries with the largest absolute decline in HRT use. In countries in which peak prevalence of HRT use was high, several studies have convincingly excluded decreasing rates of mammographic screening as an explanation for the decline in breast cancer incidence. Conversely, in some countries, no decline in breast cancer incidence is apparent that can be readily attributed to declining trends in HRT use. In such cases, declines in breast cancer incidence may be related instead to saturation or decreased utilisation of mammographic screening programmes. In other cases, it is difficult to disentangle the respective influence of trends in HRT use, and the influence of changes relating to mammographic screening. However, irrespective of time lags and varying magnitudes of effect, the data convincingly support a direct association between decreasing HRT use and declining breast cancer incidence},

	abstract = {Even though a link between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and breast cancer has been well documented in the epidemiological literature since the 1980s, it was not until publication of the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2002 and the Million Women Study in 2003 that women and doctors started reconsidering the use of HRT and sales of HRT started to drop. This paper evaluates the impact of the publication of these two landmark studies on the expected and observed changes in the incidence of breast cancer. Between 2001-2002 and 2005-2006, sharp and significant reductions in the incidence of breast cancer of up to 22\% were reported in many US and European populations, temporally consistent with the drop in usage of HRT. Declines in the rates of breast cancer were strongest for 50-60-year-old women (those most likely to be current users of HRT), affected mainly ER+ and PR+ cancers (those most strongly associated with HRT use), and were largest among women with the highest pre-decline prevalence of HRT use and the sharpest decline in its use. A considerable amount of scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that the decline in the incidence of breast cancer is in large part attributable to the sudden drop in HRT use following publication of the WHI and Million Women studies. Nevertheless, the problem of how to advise women contemplating HRT use today remains. Medical relief will remain necessary for many women with menopausal complaints, and so new therapeutic options need to be explored},
	notes = {(81) Two major studies: (1) Women's Health Initiative Study 2002, and 2) Million Women Study in 2003, two studies coming out after each other. The E/P combination of HRT was very popular and people knew that they were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Now the question is, whether with reduction in the sales and usage of HRT, do the risks of breast cancer or the incidence of breast cancer coming down as well? This is what this study is about.(82) How long does it take for a tumor to grow and what are the calculations?(81) RR = 1.22(83) Extent of reduction is something what we are findings as well. Let's see, we got US, Germany, Australia, Belgium, France, but not UK as we could not get authentic data for the year range of 1998 - 2001(82) HRT and Br Ca(82) This decrease would be most pronounced in populations with highest prevalene and longest duration. Which means, if we can stratify the prevalence and then we test the \%, see if there is a relationship between \% of usage (both pre and post) and the subsequent reduction,(82) Role of Mammographic screening(81) RR = 1.32, or RR = 1.41, plus after 15 years of use RR = 1.56??(84) Explanation as to why drop in mammography is not sufficient to explain the drop in Br Ca following discontinuation of the HRT(82) New expression of estrogen, or what?(81) So, the cumulative incidence would be something like 562 per 100, 000(81) HR = 1.24 for E/P trial lower than the cohort study result(81) Combined HRT risk, RR = 2.00, much higher than the 1.32, or 1.24, or 1.42 depending on what you see(81) Lobular more than ductal?}
