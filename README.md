# Breast Cancer Trend Study

This github repository will contain the details of the files and support materials for the research on breast cancer and trends in breast cancer that we are investigating. The purpose of this study is to test the hypotheses that as the usage of hormone replacement therapy have come down or got reduced across the world, so has the rates of breast cancer cases across the world. 

There is a history of usage of hormone replacement therapy among women who are in the post menopausal periods of their lives. During the post menopausal phases, the women have taken or used hormone replacement drugs. Some years after initiation of the hormone replacement drugs, these women were expected to develop breast cancer. However, these women also underwent routine or not breast cancer screening programmes, and many of these programmes would pick up initial signs of breast cancer or small lesions. 

The question we'd like to ask is whether there is a clear association between breast cancer risk and hormone replacement therapy from an ecological study perspective. 

This is where I intend to put all codes, support materials, and data analyses for the breast cancer research work.

The data will be analyzed using Stata and R or Julia.
